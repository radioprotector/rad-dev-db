rad-dev-db
==========

A database used during development with some dummy and actual data


When you have a better or newer database from [our project](https://github.com/radremedy/radremedy) run `./import_db <path to db>` to replace the current one.

For example on my system it is:

```
./import_db ~/Programming/open/radremedy/remedy/rad/rad.db

```

This repo should be upgraded with every database migration.
